## Favortie CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 4
 part 1 was a favorite of mine because I liked how we had to use math to find out the different values for ml, tbsp, and oz and was able to learn to use doubles.


* Lab 9
 part 1 was another one of my favorite labs because we had to implement what we learned on vectors and also booleans. I also liked how challenging the code was.

* Lab 7
 part 1 was my third favorite lab because I enjoyed having to work with if statements and having to figure out the different times in which people are allowed to park.
